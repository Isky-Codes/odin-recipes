Odin Project starter html project
This current project will help to refine my html skills by building a basic recipe website.
This project will have a main index page with links to a few different recipes.
By the end of this project, I should have a good grasp of html building blocks as well as
being able to style my website properly with CSS and add interactivity with Javascript.


Thank you for reading!
